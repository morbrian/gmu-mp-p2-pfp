<h1>Project 2: Potential Field Planning for Rigid Bodies and Manipulator Chains</h1>
<center>
</center>
<div class="contents">
<h1></h1>

<ul>
<li>Implement potential field planners
in the case of <b><em>rigid bodies (40pts) </em></b> and <b><em>manipulator chains (40pts)</em></b></li>
<li>Your implementation should also contain strategies for escaping
  local minima when the robot gets stuck <b>(15pts in case of rigid
  body, 15pts in case of manipulator)</b>. One possibility is to
  considerably increase the repulsive potential in order to push the robot away
  from the obstacle. Another one is to move in a random direction
  away from the obstacle. You could also try adding other artificial
  goal/obstacle points to guide the robot away from the real
  obstacles and toward the real goal.</li>

<li>Project is graded out of 100 points, so there is possibility of up to 10 points of extra credit</li>
<li>You can work by yourself or with a partner of your own choice</li>
<li>Implementation should be in C/C++ on top of the provided support code</li>
</ul>

<p>
Environment consists of a robot, a goal region represented as a
circle, and several obstacles represented as circles as
well. Graphical interface supports the dynamic addition and
displacement of obstacles and goal. A new obstacle can be added at any
time by pressing down the left-button of the mouse. Each obstacle and
the goal can be moved around by clicking inside them and holding the
left-button down while moving the mouse.  To run the planner, user
needs to press the key 'p' on the keyboard. Pressing 'p' again toggles
between running and stopping the planner. User can change the radius
of each obstacle and the goal by first pressing the key 'r' and then
clicking inside an obstacle/goal, holding the left-button down while
moving the mouse.  Pressing 'r' again toggles between editing radius
or moving the obstacles and the goal.

<p>
Simulator provides access to goal center, goal radius, number of
obstacles, current robot configuration (robot x, robot y, robot
theta), and vertices of the polygon representing the robot.
Simulator also computes the closest point on the i-th obstacle for any
given point (x, y), see function <b>ClosestPointOnObstacle</b>
</p>

<p>
When computing the potential, it is recommended that you use each
vertex of the polygon robot as a control point. 
<ul>
<li>
For each control
point (xj, yj), you should then
<ul>
<li>compute its Jacobian matrix Jac<sub>j</sub></li>
<li>compute the workspace gradient (wsg<sub>i</sub>) to each obstacle
  [In my implementation, wsg<sub>i</sub> is zero if  the
  distance from (xj, yj) to the closest point on the i-th obstacle is larger than a
  small constant. I then scale the gradient in order to ensure that
  the robot gets pushed away when coming 
  close to the obstacles. You may need to play around in order to
  figure out by how much to scale the gradient in order to get the
  desired behavior.]</li>
<li> use the Jacobian matrix to transform wsg<sub>i</sub> into a
  configuration space gradient csg<sub>i</sub></li>
<li>add the configuration space gradient csg<sub>i</sub> to the
  overall configuration space gradient csg</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now that the overall configuration space gradient has been
  computed, scale it so that you make a small move in x and y and a
  small move in theta. Recall that the robot should always move in
  direction opposite to the gradient. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If using <b>C++</b> support code, you should implement the
function <b>ConfigurationMove</b> in the
class <b>RigidBodyPlanner.</b> This function should
return <b>RigidBodyMove</b>, which represents a small move (dx, dy,
dtheta) by the robot.
</p>



<h2><a class="anchor" name="impNotesRigidBody">
Implementation Notes: Manipulator Chain</a></h2>

<p>
Environment consists of a 2d manipulator chain, a goal region
represented as a circle, and several obstacles represented as circles
as well.
</p>

<p>
Simulator provides access to goal center, goal radius, number of
obstacles, and start and end positions of each link in the chain.
Simulator also computes the closest point on the i-th obstacle for any
given point (x, y), see function <b>ClosestPointOnObstacle</b>
Moreover, simulator also implements Forward Kinematics, see
function <b>FK</b>.
</p>

<p>
When computing the potential, it is recommended that you use the end
position of each chain link as a control point. You should follow a
similar approach as in the case of rigid bodies. One difference is
that in the case of the manipulator chain, the attractive potential
should be computed only between the end effector (last point in the
chain) and the goal and not between any intermediate links and the
goal. In this way, the potential will guide the end effector and not
the intermediate links toward the goal. The repulsive potential, as in
the case of rigid bodies, should be computed between the end of each
link and each obstacle.
</p>

<p>
<b>Important:</b> You can use an equivalent but easier to compute
definition of the Jacobian. In this definition the partial derivative
of the forward kinematics of the end position of the j-th joint with
respect to the i-th joint angle with i <= j is given as

<ul>
<li> x = -LinkEndY(j) + LinkStartY(i)</li>
<li> y =  LinkEndX(j) - LinkStartX(i)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If using <b>C++</b> support code, you should implement the
function <b>ConfigurationMove</b> in the
class <b>ManipPlanner.</b> This function should compute small moves
for each link angle.

<ul>
<li>Support code can be found in CppRigidBodyPFP and CppManipPFP</li>
<li>To compile the code inside each directory use similar steps as in
  the case of the bug algorithms in project 1</li>
<li>The rigid body program can be run on Windows as
<b>bin\Debug\Planner.exe robotL.txt</b> and on Linux/MacOS as
<b>bin/Planner robotL.txt</b>
where the argument is the name of the robot file. You can use one of
the provided files or create your own.
</li>
<li>The manipulator chain program can be run on Windows as
<b>bin\Debug\Planner.exe nrLinks linkLength</b> and on Linux/MacOS as
<b>bin/Planner nrLinks linkLength</b>
where <b>nrLinks</b> is a positive integer representing the number of
